#summary Project roadmap

== Architecture ===
   * replace input Groovy script with new Antlr-based DSL
      * allow DSL to dynamically choose diagram type
      * allow to connect to xternal data sources, do mashups
   * Eclipse plugin
   * web based tool/web service (post snippet -> store under a unique id -> render)
   * website - submit online, store, expire. serve through PHP/Apache?
   * diff for online users
   * ability to process DOT language?
   * ability to lay out basic shape diagrams

=== Layout ===
   * learning (positioning), clustering
   * mirror/flip diagram based on x, y sizes to bring lower weight elements to the top
   * rotate for low weight
   * horizontal bars for the FR algorithm
   * baricenter, disconnected graphs
   * weights for FR algorithm
   * GEM, including random vertex selection, baricenter, local temp, skew, rot/oscillation detection
   * limit time + number of iterations
   * FR - try to fix tangling by changing forces

=== Look and Feel ===
   * shadow using gradient
   * make CSS replaceable
   * font metrics vs dpi, serif is off base
   * IE/Adobe plugin compatibility
   * add version to diagram

=== Diagram Support ===
   * class diagram add note
   * class diagram abstract (italics)
   * class diagram additional connector decorations for aggregation
   * collaboration diagram
   * triangle diagram
   * blocky diagram
   * slides

=== Misc ===
   * junit on padding
   * separate properties for layout, different kinds of layout, read {STAR  DOT properties} form the folder
   * refactor common diagram properties to the top level (header, footer, etc)
   * wire with Spring?
   * consolidate error reporting, refactor RuntimeExceptions
   * better error reports for configuration resources - missing file, missing attribute, misconfigured etc
